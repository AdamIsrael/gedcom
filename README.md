## History

I needed a GEDCOM parser. I tried the existing parsers, but I wasn't quite satisfied. They were either incomplete, weren't actively being developed/maintained, or had serious bugs. So I decided to write my own.

## Spec

Support GEDCOM 5.5 and 5.5.1, but consider adding support for other versions as they're released or encountered. There are likely quirks that will be encountered from GEDCOMs generated by some companies.
